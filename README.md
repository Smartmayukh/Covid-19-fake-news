# Covid-19-fake-news-

My second project is " Fake News traversal during Covid-19 " . 

Initially you can see nodes in different shades of violet. These are the nodes in a social media site. You can start the fake news on any node, by clicking on it. You can also adjust the consciousness of the people to find out how much influence it has on spreading of Fake news. Finally there are two bars where you can see how many people ignored the message and how many forwarded it.

You can check out the project here :
